        <p>The people of Kosovo are hospitable, friendly and very talkative. Don’t be surprised if a stranger comes up to you and talk. In many countries, this would be quite sketchy, but here in Kosovo, it will be out of curiosity about where you’re coming from and why you’re visiting Kosovo (in a good way).

        <p>Most of the younger generation speak English very well, and you won’t have a hard time to speak with them. Some of the older generation might not speak more than a few words of English, but if you happen to know Italian or German they might know that besides Albanian.- says Justin</p>

        <p>I was in Prishtina for work for 2 weeks and was connected with Explore Kosovo through a local colleague. As I was traveling by myself and have zero language skills in the Balkan region, I was very grateful to Valon who took me all around Kosovo, shared with me the rich cultural, religious, and complicated political history of the country, and left me absolutely stunned by the beauty, kindness, and generosity of this tiny country. Valon was professional, picked me up on time, and was very passionate about his work and his country. He was open and answered all my questions with honesty and objectivity. He took me to a great restaurant for local cuisine....holy YUM! I hope to be back to Kosovo to do another tour with Valon! - says Julie S </p>
